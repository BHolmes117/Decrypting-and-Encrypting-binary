# Decrypting-and-Encrypting-binary
4/11/2020

This code will decypher a integer turned into binary and back out to that integer.


To install this program, you will need to have jave eclipse( don't worry you don't need to download javafx for this code)


When it comes to installing this, you will have to understand what InputStream ,FileInputStream, OutputStream, encryptedOutputStream, FileOutputStream, encryptedInputStream,byteRead, and decryptedStream in order for this to work.
You will want to make your code so it will take in the file of integers.
After that, put it in an array so that it will count each byte. 
I concluded that i would spilt the byte to make it easiser to count in the end, but make to where it suits you best. 
As the integers are being compiled, you will want it to be decrypted into binary.
Next, it should show the binary reversed, which is an extra encryption you will want to have. 
Once you show it has been flipped or reversed, it should go back to it's original binary and adding in the decryption will turn it back into integers or integer.
Almost forgot to mention, make your you have the main method and in the main method it should have throws exception so it will cancel if the code try to go past the file line.
